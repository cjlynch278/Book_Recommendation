# 📚 Book Recommendation App

I've created this app as a sandbox to practice, review, and showcase some of the ML and GenAI tools that I've worked on. This is an app that gives personalized book recommendations based on user preference and history.

Whether you're looking to find your next favorite novel, explore a new genre, or build a personalized reading list, this app has you covered.
